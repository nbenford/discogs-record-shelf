[Discogs Record Shelf](https://discogs-record-shelf-e0e54663a588.herokuapp.com/) keeps track of vinyl stylus wear using your Discogs account

Audiophiles demand uncompromising sound. One of the most important factors in ensuring optimal vinyl record playback is ensuring that the turntable's cartridge and stylus is in good shape. Styli have a finite lifespan. Over the many hours of play, the stylus wears down and sound reproduction suffers. Damage to the vinyl records can occur if the stylus is allowed to wear down too much.

But how does the music lover track how many hours are left on their stylus? <b>Discogs Record Shelf</b> offers a solution.

[Discogs.com](https://discogs.com) is a website where users can find specific release information for almost every record, CD, and tape that has been released throughout the decades. It's also one of the top marketplaces for selling and buying records. As a result, it's become the most popular place for audiophiles to store and view their album collection.

Discogs Record Shelf connects the user to their Discogs account and allows them to browse their record collection virtually. Cartridges and styli can be registered and record plays can be logged to a cartridge or stylus to track wear. Discogs Record Shelf will attempt to prefill the record runtime with data from Discogs. If Discogs doesn't have it, the app asks OpenAI to try its best to estimate runtime. It will also provide the user with a short blurb about the record. Maybe you'll learn something new about an old favorite.

The Plays table shows an overview of albums played and to which cartridge or stylus. Basic record info and tracklists for each record are also provided.

Want to play a record that's not in your collection yet? No problem. Use the barcode scanner to log the record, or search via catalog number if the album lacks a barcode.

User authentication is done entirely by Discogs, so users don't need to register with Discogs Record Shelf itself. If you have a Discogs account, you can use Discogs Record Shelf with just a few clicks. Enjoy, and keep your records immaculate!
